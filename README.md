# Flight Howto

Search and display useful hints on how to use the `flight` suite

## Installation

The application requires a modern(ish) version of `ruby`/`bundler`. It has been designed with the following versions in mind:
* centos7
* ruby 2.7.1
* bundler 2.1.4

After downloading the source code (via git or other means), the gems need to be installed using bundler:

```
cd /path/to/source
bundle install --with default --without development --path vendor
```

## Configuration

See the [reference config](etc/config.reference) for the list of configuration keys. The config
must be saved relative to the repos root director (aka the directory containing this file).

```
vi etc/config.yaml # Add/edit keys specified in the reference
```

## Operation

Markdown documents must be added to the how to CLI manually. The default path to the directory depends on if `flight_ROOT` has been set:

```
# If `flight_ROOT` has not been exported to the environment, then a relative
# path from the README direcotry is used
var/flight/etc/howto

# If the default `flight_ROOT` has been exported
/opt/flight/etc/howto

# If you updated the internal etc/config.yaml
.. anywhere you want ..
```

The file extension must be `.md`:

```
./flight/etc/howto/my-guide.md        # Valid
./flight/etc/howto/my-guide.markdown  # Ignored
```

To list all the guides within the directory:

```
bin/howto list
```

To view a particular guide:

```
bin/howto show my-guide
... displays my-guide ...
```

        Search for a how-to guide by it's name or close approximation.
        Exact name matches are recommended in order to gaurantee a particular
        guide is returned.

        Failing an exact match, a close approximation shall be used instead.
        This should yield the expect guide if the search name is similar to the
        target. For example, NAME_OR_FUZZY could be:
         * The leading prefix to the guide,
         * A key word within the guide's name, or
         * A minor typo in the spelling.
